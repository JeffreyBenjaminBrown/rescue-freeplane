# How to use it

If these instructions don't work for you, please let me know,
e.g. by posting an issue to Github's issue tracker for this project.

Install [stack for Haskell](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/).
From the root of this project, run `stack ghci`.
Then run `convert "path"`, where `path`
is an absolute or relative path to the `.mm` file you want to convert,
*not* including the `.mm` extension.
A similarly-named `.org` file will appear next to it.

# Why

I'll be using this, I think, to restore my freeplane data.
I'll initially convert it to .org.
Eventually I'd like to put it into SmSn or Hode.
