# How to use it

For safety, copy the data to be converted to this folder.
It should be `.mm` files.
For each file called `name.mm`,
strip the file extension and run `convert name`.
A file called `name.org` will be created next to it.

# Why

I'll be using this, I think, to restore my freeplane data.
I'll initially convert it to .org.
Eventually I'd like to put it into SmSn or Hode.
